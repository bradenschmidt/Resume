\makelettertitle

I am writing to apply for the posted position of Java/Web Administrator (1 year term) (Saskatoon, Wholesale), which has been posted on coopconnection.ca. I have enclosed my resume for your perusal.

I recently graduated with distinction from the University of Saskatchewan with a degree in Computer Science. During these years of study, I developed a passion for web development, database management, and API development, among other things.

I have experience in development with Java, through University course work, Android development, and Java Servlets. I enjoy working with business relations and providing tools for consumers or businesses. I have worked for Saskatoon Coop and have used CRS services in the past. I have also worked in the Federated Coop building in downtown Saskatoon doing building renovations.

I am particularly adept at creating ideas, then planning and organizing the methods needed to deliver effective results. I have demonstrated this in my independent work as well as group work where I often assumed the position of group leader.

I am a conscientious, disciplined person who works hard and pays attention to detail. I am flexible, quick to pick up new skills, and eager to learn. I am keen to work for a company that I can contribute to and share my enthusiasm for modern development. I have excellent references and would be happy to discuss any possible vacancies with you at your convenience.

If you do not have an opening for me at this time, I would appreciate if you would keep my resume on file for any future possibilities.
